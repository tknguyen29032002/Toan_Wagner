Author: Toan Nguyen <tnguyen29032002@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 24 20:08:16 2025 +0000

    Refactor ComputerAITest: Fix incorrect assertions and add missing test validations
    
    - Fixed testSelectTargetNoRooms: Changed incorrect assertTrue(targets.isEmpty()) to assertFalse, and fixed inverted logic in assertions (targets.contains should be true, multiple selections should prove randomness)
    - Enhanced testCreateSuggestionOnlyOneWeaponNotSeen: Added missing assertion to verify knifeCard is actually selected as the only unseen weapon
    - Enhanced testCreateSuggestionExcludesCardsInHand: Added missing assertion to verify revolverCard is selected when knifeCard is in hand
    
    These changes ensure tests properly validate the Computer AI logic and catch potential bugs in the createSuggestion and selectTargets methods.
