AREAS FOR REVIEW
================================================================================

1. BOARD CLASS - Game Setup & Card Dealing (Board.java lines 243-304)
   Focus: createDeck() and dealCards() methods
   Questions:
   - Is the random card selection logic clear?
   - Should we validate deck size before dealing?
   - Any edge cases we missed?

2. PLAYER SUGGESTION SYSTEM (Player.java lines 40-66)
   Focus: disproveSuggestion() method
   Questions:
   - Is the random selection when multiple cards match implemented correctly?
   - Should we add logging for debugging?
   - Any performance concerns?

3. ADJACENCY CALCULATION (Board.java lines 345-490)
   Focus: calcAdjacencies() and helper methods
   Questions:
   - Is the door and secret passage logic easy to understand?
   - Should we break it down into smaller methods?
   - Any potential bugs with edge cases?

DESIGN DISCUSSION - NEXT BUTTON FLOW
================================================================================

We have a flowchart (NextButtonFlowchart.md) showing our planned implementation
for the Next button functionality. Key design decisions needed:

1. Should human player actions be fully event-driven or use a flag system?

2. How to handle computer player auto-execution vs human player waiting?

3. Best way to validate turn completion before allowing Next?
